TimeTrack
=========

Time Track is a time management system that allows timing of active desktop application throughout the day. When you are active in an application TimeTrack monitors how long you perform tasks in the window and saves the window or process name.

Logs can be viewed collectively and times summed together to visualize how much time you spend on a task.

Screenshots can also be logged if enabled when a new active window is selected.

Window names can also be modified using regular expressions to fit your liking.

Future implementations: Preform final save before shutdown, Navigation Between days, Add idle timeout preference
